# KOReader User Patches

## 2-minimal-book-stats-screensaver.lua
A clean, minimalist KOReader screensaver showing key reading statistics.
Displays progress, pages left, time left, highlights, notes, and battery percentage.

Based on the Book Receipt plugin by [Omer Faruq](https://github.com/omer-faruq).
Modified and redesigned for a minimalist style by me (and mostly ChatGPT).
**Original code:** Created by Reddit user [hundredpercentcocoa](https://www.reddit.com/user/hundredpercentcocoa/)

**Features:**
- Can be triggered via shortcut ("XXX" under "Reader")
- Can be set as screensaver/sleep screen ("XXX" > XXX)
- When added as wallpaper, it provides background color options (white/black/transparent/random image)
- Selecting the random image option searches for a `book_receipt_background` folder under the `koreader` folder and randomly picks one of its images as the background; if the folder is missing, the background defaults to transparent

**Modifications in this fork:**
– Renamed from "book receipt" to "minimal book stats"
- Removed chapter stats
- Added extra stats
